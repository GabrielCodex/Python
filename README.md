# Python

## Variables

```python

my_variable = 12


```

Type inference allows python to know what type without declaring it.


## Bools

```python
my_bool = True

``

Bools are capital in Python compared to lowercased in swift

## Reassign

```python
my_variable = 3

```

Reassigning is the same as Swift

## White Space

White space is used to structure code in Python so you have TO BE CAREFUL in how you use it

Error message for bad indention: **IndentationError: expected an indented block**

Below is an example of correct white space. Common pratice is two or four white space. 
```python

def spam():
	eggs = 12
	return eggs
print spam()
```

## Comments

For single line comments use a hastag: #
for multi-line comments use triple quoations marks

```python

""" I am going to get a job
"""

# Keeping working 

```
